## __Firefox Private Network (Beta) Privacy Notice__
Version 2.0, dated December 3, 2019

# __At Mozilla, we design products with your privacy in mind.__

This privacy notice explains what data is needed to offer Firefox Private Network (“Service”) and why.

To learn more about how we receive and handle information, and how you can engage with your data, read the Mozilla Privacy Policy.

## __Things you should know:__

### Firefox Private Network Requires a Firefox Account. {: #firefoxaccount }
This service requires a Firefox Account, which sends Mozilla your email address, locale, and IP address. Learn more about [Firefox Account data practices](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/firefox/#firefox-accounts-join-firefox).

### There are two options for Firefox Private Network. {: #trustedpartners }
1. FPN Browser Protection, which protects your web browsing within Firefox, and
2. FPN Full-Device (VPN) Protection, which protects all your device’s internet connections.

Our partner for FPN Browser Protection is Cloudflare. Our partner for FPN Full-device Protection is Mullvad.

### Both FPN Browser Protection and FPN Full-Device Protection Receive Location, Technical, and Interaction Data. {: #FPN }
* Firefox sends Mozilla data about your device, operating system, version, and a unique identifier that Mozilla connects to your Firefox Account and receives data about when you install Firefox Private Network, when you use the service, and engage with our surveys and Firefox. Read the telemetry documentation for [FPN Browser Protection](https://github.com/mozilla/secure-proxy/blob/master/docs/metrics.md).
* Because FPN is currently limited to the US, we store the IP addresses used to access your Firefox Account in order to approximate your country.

### Enabling this Service keeps most of your internet activity private from your internet service provider by encrypting and routing it through our partners’ networks instead. {: #private }

__FPN Browser Protection__

__Cloudflare receives your web browsing data to provide the Service.__ As you browse, Firefox will encrypt the data you send to websites and send it to Cloudflare. Cloudflare will also receive your computer’s IP address, the IP address of the site you are browsing to, the timestamp, and a unique identifier. Cloudflare does not share this data with others and deletes this after 24 hours unless necessary for its security or legal obligations. Learn more at [Cloudflare’s Privacy Notice for Firefox Private Network](https://www.cloudflare.com/mozilla/firefox-private-network-privacy-notice/).

__This Service protects most—but not all—of your web browsing.__ The Service only works in Firefox and for websites that communicate with your computer using TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). For example, it does not work for data exchanged on certain video conferencing services (such as Google Hangouts, Facebook Messenger, GoToMeeting) or on applications outside of Firefox (such as other apps on your device). [Learn more here.](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/video-calls-fpn).

__Mozilla receives information about how many passes you’ve used.__ When you sign up for FPN Browser Protection, you get a certain number of passes per month. Mozilla receives information about how many of your passes you’ve used and associates that information with your Firefox Account.

__FPN Full-Device Protection__

 __Subscription Information.__ Mozilla receives a record of your subscription and information about the status of your account’s subscription and payment, but Mozilla does not receive your payment card details.

 __Mullvad receives your internet traffic to provide the Service.__ When you activate FPN Full-Device Protection, FPN will encrypt your internet traffic and send it to Mullvad. Mullvad has committed not to log any of the data it receives. Learn more at [Mullvad's Privacy Policy](https://mullvad.net/en/help/no-logging-data-policy/).

 __Mozilla uses Stripe to Process Payments.__ Mozilla uses a third party, Stripe, to process payment information. You can learn more about Stripe’s data practices by reading their [Global Privacy Policy](https://stripe.com/privacy).
